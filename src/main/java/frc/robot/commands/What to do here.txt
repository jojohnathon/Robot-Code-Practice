Your commands folder should hold the files for all the commands you define for the robot
    Commands, unlike subsystems, typically are not singletons. Commands must define which subsystems they will require so that the 
    CommandScheduler can avoid running conflicting commands at the same time. Command actions can be divided into 3 methods - initialize,
    which will run once when the command is first scheduled, execute which will run every 20ms while the Command is running, and end,
    which will run once when the command ends.
    
    Commands typically use the basic, low level methods provided by the subsystems and perform the complex logic necessary to accomplish
    a task. Commands often vary in complexity depending on what goal they wish to attend. Individual commands can be chained into
    command groups using a variety of methods, including many convenience factors.
